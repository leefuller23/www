If you are seeing this, it means it is working omg!

Since 2015 my site has been hosted at digital ocean, google compute engine, heroku, linode and cloudflare pages.

Starting now it is hosted at home and generated and served by my lab hardware. I will maybe do a writeup with some details on how it works. It continues to be available at .io and .uk and it is still ultimately based on a git repo and Hugo static site generator. Now just with more downtime.
