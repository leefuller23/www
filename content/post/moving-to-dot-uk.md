Starting June 2022 I am gradually moving my .io domain over to .uk

## Why

[Read the .io Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io)

## Backwards compatibility

All the previous pointers to the .io domain will continue to work.

I'm a big fan of backwards compatability. If you use an app or service and it points to something.leefuller.io it will continue to work into the future. Same for email.

## Status
As of 04/06/2022 Email and Website are supported at .uk and .io

My self hosted 'qtnet' apps are more complex and probably needs me to swap [SWAG](https://fleet.linuxserver.io/image?name=linuxserver/swag) for [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) so watch this space.

Mail - complete - email anything at leefuller.io or .uk and i will get it :)

Site - Mostly complete (includes Element - now available at [leefuller.uk/element](https://leefuller.uk/element)) - still have some absolute links on my site pointing to .io - I will update these over time :)
