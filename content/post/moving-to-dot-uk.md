Starting June 2022 I am gradually moving my .io domain over to .uk

## Why

[Read the .io Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io)

## Backwards compatibility

All the previous pointers to the .io domain will continue to work.

I'm a big fan of backwards compatability. If you use an app or service and it points to something.leefuller.io it will continue to work into the future. Same for email.
