Starting June 2022 I am gradually moving my .io domain over to .uk

## Why

[Read the .io Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io)

## Backwards compatibility

All the previous pointers to the .io domain will continue to work.

I'm a big fan of backwards compatability. If you use an app or service and it points to something.leefuller.io it will continue to work into the future. Same for email.

## Status
As of 04/06/2022 Email and Website are supported at .uk and .io - My self hosted 'qtnet' apps are more complex and still pending.

Mail - complete

Site - Mostly complete (includes Element - now available at [leefuller.uk/element](https://leefuller.uk/element)) - still have some absolute links on my site pointing to .io - I will update these over time :)

qtflix - Pending

qtchat - Pending

qtsync - NA (Syncthing uses p2p-like trackers and hostname is irrelevant)

qtcloud - Pending

qtvpn - Pending

qtcctv - Pending

qtwarrior - NA (No public access necessary)
