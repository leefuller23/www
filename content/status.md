Retiring qtnet-srv1. Going forward this device will see occasional use for development and testing.

This will reduce the amount of CPU and RAM but will increase storage speed and capacity (thanks to all SSD storage) and reduce the power consumption by over 300w.

Intermittent outages expected until further notice!
