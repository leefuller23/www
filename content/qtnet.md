## Executive summary
qtnet is the name of my home network. All my self hosted apps are ripoffs of existing commercial services with "qt" on the start. Nextcloud is 'qtcloud', plex is 'qtfilx' etc.

By using the convention of a fake company name, it makes it simple for me to to follow the enterprise techniques I apply at $DAYJOB to everything from naming physical assets, through to app testing/staging and documentation.
