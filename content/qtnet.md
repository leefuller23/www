## wtf?
qtnet is the name of my home network. My self hosted apps are inspired by successful commercial services, powered by mostly open source software, and get "qt" lazily prefixed to the name.

Nextcloud is 'qtcloud', plex is 'qtfilx' etc. Why qt? Because im cute. Im more than cute, I'm adorable. My network = qtnet.

You get it. It's childish. But its my expensive hobbby so I get to name it, right? =)

Also by using a consistent fake company name and consistent (fake) product names, it makes it much easier for me to to follow the enterprise techniques I use at work. This means naming servers, VMs, containers, CI/CD pipelines, all the way through to testing/staging and documentation.
